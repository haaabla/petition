    <h2>Save The Reef</h2>

    <div class="introduction">
        <p>The oceans are dying at an alarming rate. Reefs that were once full of life with beautiful colorful coral are now bleached. Let's do this and bring back the color to the reef.

        If we want our kids the same opportunities to see what we have been able to let's join forces by signing the petition and bring back the color!
